                    <p>
                    The emerging new interest in <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong> has led to a paradigm shift in the field of
                    computer architecture. Architectures that focus on machine learning and neuromorphic computing are increasingly being
                    adopted into the mainstream. The design of future processors is increasingly being predicated on metrics based on
                    cognitive applications. The interplay between the development of state-of-the-art algorithms in cognitive sciences,
                    computer vision, speech recognition and the design of the underlying system architectures has resulted in several 
                    cross-disciplinary advances. After highly successful editions of the Workshop on Cognitive Architectures in the past,
                    in this year’s edition we expect to consolidate the many recent works in this field and provide concrete roadmaps as to
                    what subsequent directions the research in this field should take. This workshop at HPCA proposes to bring together
                    researchers and practitioners within systems architecture, computer vision, artificial intelligence and robotics to
                    discuss the latest ideas, applications and commercialization strategies around the cognitive computing theme. In addition,
                    it also aims to foster an interest in such emerging fields among industry and academic researchers alike. The primary focus
                    is expected to be on driving towards a better understanding of key cognitive algorithms of interest and the allied architectural 
                    support issues. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Of particular interest are application areas of <strong>mobile cognition</strong>, which may comprise of a distributed
                    swarm of <em>intelligent</em> computing modules. This paradigm is relevant in the context of unmanned aerial vehicles
                    and connected cars.  Further, the rising investment by industry in designing IoT (Internet-of-Things) platforms, has
                    resulted in several opportunities to build architectures that support capabilities such as intelligent data exchange and 
                    interaction with cloud, pattern matching, data analytics and other cognitive aspects to build truly transformative systems.

                    <p>
                    Recent advances in architectures for AI have been instrumental in the development and deployment of autonomous systems,
                    such as self-driving vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The Tesla FSD and Nvidia Xavier SoC are examples of commercial
                    chips in the autonomous driving space with dedicated hardware units for processing AI algorithms. Next-generation processors
                    in this domain are being envisioned as multi-agent systems that support swarm-based decision-making, as well as intelligent
                    data exchange capabilities amongst each other or with a backing cloud server. The proliferation of mobile computing platforms, 
                    Internet-of-Things and cloud support features thereof have opened up exciting new opportunities for such real-time, mobile 
                    (distributed or swarm-driven) cognition. The CogArch workshop solicits formative ideas and new product offerings in this general 
                    space.

                    Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
